# The Enneagram Shiny App

While trying to learn how to build Shiny Apps, I decided to try my hand at creating an online personaity quiz, mostly out of curiosity. The quiz I had immediate access to was the Enneagram, as I had the questions and the scoring method just sitting on my shelf. The complete test consists of 144 questions (and it is time consuming to take). Here I present the full form, along with personality scoring and links leading to several different websites explaining what exactly each type means.

This is the final app:

*“THE ENNEAGRAM (pronounced “ANY-a-gram”) is a geometric figure that maps out the nine fundamental personality types of human nature and their complex interrelationships. It is a development of modern psychology that has roots in spiritual wisdom from many different ancient traditions.”*
